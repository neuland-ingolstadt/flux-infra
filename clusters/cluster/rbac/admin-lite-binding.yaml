# ClusterRoleBinding for admin-lite role
#
# HOW TO FIND YOUR USERNAME:
#
# 1. Check your current authenticated user:
#    kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.users[0].name}'
#
# 2. Or check what Kubernetes sees you as:
#    kubectl auth can-i --list
#    (Look at the "User:" line at the top)
#
# 3. Or extract from kubeconfig:
#    kubectl config view --raw -o jsonpath='{.users[?(@.name=="YOUR_CONTEXT_USER")].user}'
#
# 4. For client certificate auth, the username is typically in the CN (Common Name):
#    kubectl config view --raw -o jsonpath='{.users[0].user.client-certificate-data}' | \
#      base64 -d | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep "Subject:"
#
# COMMON AUTHENTICATION METHODS:
#
# - Client Certificate: Username is usually the CN from the certificate
# - Token/ServiceAccount: Username format is "system:serviceaccount:NAMESPACE:NAME"
# - OIDC/OAuth: Username is typically the email or subject from the OIDC provider
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# For a user authenticated with client certificate (CN=john.doe):
# subjects:
#   - kind: User
#     name: "john.doe"
#     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
#
# For a user authenticated via OIDC (email):
# subjects:
#   - kind: User
#     name: "user@example.com"
#     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
#
# For groups (e.g., from OIDC/OAuth):
# subjects:
#   - kind: Group
#     name: "developers"
#     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
#
